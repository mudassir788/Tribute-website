      <h1>Founder Of Pakistan</h1>
        he party arose out of the need for the political representation of
        Muslims in British India, especially during the Indian National
        Congress-sponsored massive Hindu opposition to the 1905 partition of
        Bengal. During the 1906 annual meeting of the All India Muslim Education
        Conference held in Israt Manzil Palace, Dhaka, the Nawab of Dhaka,
        Khwaja Salimullah, forwarded a proposal to create a political party
        which would protect the interests of Muslims in British India. He
        suggested the political party be named the 'All-India Muslim League'.
        The motion was unanimously passed be league into a popular
        organisation. The Muslim League played a decisive role in the
        1940s, becoming a driving force behind the division of India along
        religious lines and the creation of Pakistan as a Muslim state in
        1947.
